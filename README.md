# Ecommerce


## Description

This repo contains the back end portion of an ecommerce site that uses an Express.js API to interact with a MySQL database using the Sequelize package. First I established a connection to the database using Sequelize. Next I created the models for each table in the database and added associations to connect them to each other. Then I created the get routes as well as the create, update, and delete routes for each data model. Below is a link that shows each route functioning.
